# STAT 240 Final Project – Spring 2025

**Title:** Comparing Average COVID-19 Death Rates by Mask Usage in U.S. Counties  
**Course:** STAT 240 – Data Science Modeling I  
**Instructor:** Bret Larget
**Group Members:** Evan Blecher, Samira Ali, Moyraa Ali, Xinyi Lyu
**Date:** May 2025

## Project Overview

This group project investigates whether there is a statistically significant difference in average COVID-19 death rates across U.S. counties with varying levels of reported mask usage. The analysis combines data wrangling, visualizations, and hypothesis testing to draw conclusions from public health data.

## My Contributions (Evan Blecher)

- **Data Visualization**: Created and interpreted histograms, boxplots, and comparative graphics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Led the hypothesis testing process including:
  - Defining **parameter of interest** and appropriate **test statistic**
  - Specifying **null and alternative hypotheses**
  - Checking **assumptions** and assessing **normality**
  - Computing and interpreting the **test statistic** and **null distribution**
  - Providing final **statistical results and interpretation**

---

## Objectives

- Explore how mask usage rates correlate with COVID-19 death rates.
- Apply statistical inference techniques learned in class.
- Practice effective data communication through visualizations and narrative.

## Files

- `Stat-240-final.html` – Final report (rendered from R Markdown)
- `Stat-240-final.Rmd` – R Markdown source code
- `data/` – Folder containing all cleanedda and original datasets

---

## Key Findings

- Counties with higher levels of mask usage tended to show **higher COVID-19 death rates** on average, due to population density.
- Statistical analysis indicated a **significant difference** in death rates across mask usage categories.
- The assumptions of the test were checked and met, allowing for valid inference.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **R**
- `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `infer`
